This API will allow you to send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). It will also let you retrieve messages sent from the offices of departure and destination.

We have now released the API with working arrivals and departures endpoints for Great Britain and Northern Ireland. You can now also run tests for Great Britain and Northern Ireland movements in HMRC's sandbox environment.
