This API will allow you to send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). It will also let you retrieve messages sent from the offices of departure and destination.

We are releasing Phase 5 functionality incrementally starting with the IE015C Departure Declaration endpoint to create a new departure movement.
