    # Overview
    Use the CTC Traders API to send departure and arrival movements to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS)
    and to get messages sent from customs offices of departure and destination.
    <br/><br/>
    You can use this version of the API to send both small messages (up to 5MB in size) and large messages 
    (up to 8MB in size). The large messages capability applies only to POST endpoints. 
    Although you can use the large messages functionality of the API to send both large and small messages, 
    you cannot use the small messages functionality of the API to send large messages.
    <br/><br/>
    For a detailed overview of v2.0 of the API and information about how to send large messages, 
    see [CTC Traders API phase 5 service guide](/guides/ctc-traders-phase5-service-guide/).

      summary: Send a declaration data message
      description: |
        Send a transit declaration to the customs office of departure to notify it that you wish to carry out a transit operation.

        This request is also called an ‘Declaration Data’ E_DEC_DAT (IE015) message.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response:
        
        - will contain a URI, which you can use to get the message status
        - will contain the departure ID specifying the departure returned
        - can also include an optional box ID, which you can use to match this movement to any messages received from the Push Pull Notifications API
        
        If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 8MB), a successful response will include:
        
        - a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
        - a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

        **Note:** If an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number has not been assigned to you, an HTTP 403 Forbidden error is returned.

      description: >
        Get all departure declarations sent to the customs office of departure within the past 60 days.

        You can filter for departure declarations updated before and/or after a specific date and time, and optionally filter for departure declarations with a specific EORI.

        For a multi-page query you can filter for a specific page, and optionally the number of items per page.

        Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.
        
        A successful response will include the total count of the number of movements and a Movement Reference Number (MRN) only after it has been allocated to a movement.
        <br/><br/>
        **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement. 
        Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

        For a multi-page query you can filter for a specific page and optionally the number of items per page.
        
        Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.
        <br/><br/>
        **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement. 
        Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

        For example, if you are a trader at destination, you will send an ‘Unloading Remarks’ E_ULD_REM (IE044) message to the office of destination indicating that unloading of the goods has been completed.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a small message (up to 5MB), a successful response will contain a URI, an arrival ID, and a message ID related to the arrival, which you can use to get the message status.
        <br/><br/>
        If you use this endpoint to send a large message (up to 8MB), a successful response will include:
        
        - a URL and additional metadata that you must use when uploading your file
        - an arrival ID, specifying the arrival to return
        - a message ID that allows you track the status of that specific message

        **Note:** If an Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number has not been assigned to you, an HTTP 403 Forbidden error is returned.

      summary: Get a cached message related to an arrival and message ID
      description: >
        Get a message related to a specific arrival and message ID that have been received within the past 60 days.
        
        For example, this could include messages about route diversions or unloading permissions.
        
        Movements older than 60 days and their related messages are archived and cannot be returned by the API.
        <br/><br/>
        A successful response can be returned in one of the following formats based on the provided `Accept` header:
        
         - `application/vnd.hmrc.2.0+json-xml`: JSON-wrapped XML, where the message is provided as an XML string sent as part of JSON payload containing other metadata
         - `application/vnd.hmrc.2.0+json`: JSON, where the message is provided as a sub-document sent as part of a JSON payload containing other metadata
        
        **Note:** You can view a transit movement only if your Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number matches the EORI number that created the transit declaration for that movement. 
        Your EORI number is part of the bearer token that you use for API authentication.
