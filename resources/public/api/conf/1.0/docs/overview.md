Use the CTC Traders API to:

- send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS)
- retrieve messages sent from customs offices of departure and destination

The API endpoints relate only to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

You can also use the HMRC sandbox environment to run tests for Great Britain and Northern Ireland transit movements.

**Please note:** This version of the API supports only NCTS Phase 4. Version 2.0 of the API supports NCTS Phase 5.
