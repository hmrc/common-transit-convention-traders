This API will allow you to send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). It will also let you retrieve messages sent from the offices of departure and destination.

__We have now released the API with working arrivals endpoints. You can now run tests in HMRC's sandbox environment.__

To review our progress and to see what you can test, take at look at our [Roadmap](https://developer.qa.tax.service.gov.uk/roadmaps/common-transit-convention-traders-roadmap).

Further details of the User Restricted Authentication are given on the 
[Authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.

For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, 
see [Tutorials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).
