This API will allow you to send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). It will also let you retrieve messages sent from the offices of departure and destination.

__The CTC Traders API is now live and in production (for GB movements only).__

To review our progress and see what you can test, take a look at our [Roadmap](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/roadmaps/common-transit-convention-traders-roadmap/)

Further details of the User Restricted Authentication are given on the [Authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.

For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, see [Tutorials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).
