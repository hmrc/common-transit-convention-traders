This API will allow you to send departure and arrival movement notifications to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). It will also let you retrieve messages sent from the offices of departure and destination.

We have now released the API with working arrivals and departures endpoints for Great Britain and Northern Ireland. You can now also run tests for Great Britain and Northern Ireland movements in HMRC's sandbox environment.

* Read our [Roadmap](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/roadmaps/common-transit-convention-traders-roadmap/) to review our progress and see what you can test.
* Read our step by step [CTC Testing Guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/common-transit-convention-traders-testing-guide/) to learn how to test. This signposts you to all the information and resources you will need.

Further details of the User Restricted Authentication are given on the
[Authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.
